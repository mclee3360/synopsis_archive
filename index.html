                The MAL Rewrite team on
                <a class="away_links" href="http://myanimelist.net">MyAnimeList</a>
                is an organization dedicated to creating orignal, high quality
                synopses for the various anime, manga, and other entries on
                the site. As a member of the team, I have contributed to a
                variety of different synopses as both a writer and an editor.
                This page is a record of all the different synopses I have been
                involved in. <br>
                <br>
                For clarification, the writer is the one who creates the
                synopses originally. They also can choose whether or not to have
                a hand in the "final edit," where they look over the changes
                that the editors have made and make some finishing touches. The
                editors are the ones who clean the written synopses and make
                sure that the content is up to standard. Each synopsis goes
                through two phases of editing. All synopses are checked over by
                the coordinators for approval before upload, where they make
                some final edits of their own as well. <br>
                <br>
                All synopses that have been written by MAL Rewrite are tagged as
                [Written by MAL Rewrite] at the end of the synopsis on the
                website.<br>
